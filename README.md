# Nba-Draft-Database
A database project focused on developing an Nba Draft information system. It encompasses project specifications, an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, transformation of the ER model into relational tables, DML and DDL queries.

# Project Specification
The project specification outlines the requirements, objectives, and scope of the database project. It serves as a guide for development and implementation. Refer to [Project Specification](Vukasin_Dokmanovic_RA_89_2020_Finalno.docx) for detailed project specifications.

# Entity-Relationship (ER) model
The ER model represents the conceptual structure of the database, defining entities, relationships, and attributes. View the ER model diagram in [ER Model Diagram](Vukasin_Dokmanovic_RA_89_2020_EER_Finalno.png) file.

# ER to Relational Table Transformation
The ER model is transformed into relational tables following normalization principles. View the relational schema in [Transformation](Vukasin_Dokmanovic_RA_89_2020_Prevodjenje_Finalno.pdf) file.

# Data Definition Language Queries
The DDL queries define the structure of the database schema, including tables, constraints, and indexes. View the DDL queries in [DDL](Vukasin_Dokmanovic_RA_89_2020.ddl) file.

# Insert queries
Insert queries populate the database with initial data, facilitating testing and demonstration of functionality. View the insert queries in [DML](Vukasin_Dokmanovc_RA_89_2020.sql) file.
